It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.), overnight ski trips to Vermont, overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer, summer picnics at Chelsea piers, and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody. * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding, but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.",Yes,No,3,11,No,No,[],Yes,No

Everyone is striving for limited promotions and visibility, and that leads to people sabotaging or just not helping each other. - Managers are powerful. If yours doesn't want you to succeed, they have a great deal of control over your future at the company. - Switching teams is not as easy as advertised. Honestly, applying to Google from the outside is easier than trying to join a new team. If your manager doesn't want you to switch teams, you will not switch teams. - HR will not help you if a problematic situation happens. They are there to protect the company. While nice individuals, they will happily tell you untrue information to help Google and hurt you. - Promotion culture is insidious. Everyone is trying to get promoted to make more money, and the system around promotion encourages the wrong kinds of risk-taking: bold but useless new products, hoarding credit, blaming others for your mistakes. - If a product is at risk, one or two people may be collectively blamed to save the whole. I saw this happen multiple times. A deadline is missed, so an agreement is hatched the the problem was person X or person Y. That way, person X or Y can be fired and the others promoted because they made progress despite working with someone as lowly as X or Y. - Fakeness. Individuals at Google are largely wonderful, but the company encourages you to keep and tow the line. Smile. Be Googley. Pretend we're all collaborating openly. But, in the back of everyone's mind is their career path, their promo, and how other people can be used to get them there or discarded if they do not. - A few PMs and manager are very poor performers and their teams suffer as a result. Many PMs and managers are wonderful. It depends on the team you get, which is largely a question of luck. - A culture which somewhat coddles through its benefits leads some to stay dependent and socially immature, especially if joined right out of college.",No,No,4,4,No,No,[],Yes,No

You will have no time to use the nap pod that all of your friends love to ask you about - SMB Sales/Google Marketing Solutions is seen as a ""younger"" organization within the company and within overall Google sales. It is very difficult to rise the ranks, as this reputation follows you throughout your career journey. - A significant amount of account strategists and direct sales employees within the organization are extremely unhappy. Many are absolutely miserable. The work is mundane and people are constantly complaining as the organization continues to operate across the same metrics, incentives, and programs that it has been for almost 10 years. You will not hear a lot about this, as employees always feel the pressure of saying that they are happy at one of the 'best companies in the world to work for'. No one wants to be the one who is complaining about problems at Google to their friends outside the company. - Perks, culture, and company reputation will keep you way past your expiration date. You will find out you should have moved on way too late. - The hiring bar has severely decreased as the company gets larger. Mediocre employees are hired based on industry experience, but have a very hard time ramping up to Google's way of doing things, and are often unable to keep up. - The process of performance reviews and promotions will at one way or another negatively impact you.

You can provide great benefit to users worldwide. The right answer to a search query can literally save a life, reorient a career, or enrich a relationship.

It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I've seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing.  1. management sucks My manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... ""fairness"" is NEVER been seen at this team.  2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!  3. STEALING/CHEATING I've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers.

Marketing and bigger vision sometimes comes from the product managers, but it always feels like individual advice rather than a single clear vision of where we should go.  Individual teams have a lot of control over libraries and code they use, so lots of infrastructure projects grow as research projects that succeed only if adopted by significant numbers of other teams.  Although there is a big vision for the company, it isn't as focused or controlled as in other companies, there's really an assumption that the right stuff will bubble up. It's not a place with the razor-focused direction.  Initial titles/ranks and promotions are determined by committees of other engineers. This is great because you're recognized for your engineering work, but bad if you aren't churning out enough code or if you're not having enough impact on the rest of the company. Initial titles get assigned 6-12 months in when you're put in the same pool as existing Googlers who are up for promotion. If you don't match up to them, you go down a slot - no difference in salary, bonuses based on new level, and any mental scars from being judged unworthy.

That is true, but in my opinion the non-existent HR is the bane of Google. I don't mean the HR folks that take care of your 401k's and administrivia, they were good to work with. I mean those who affect your career. About once a year, the director of HR for all of engineering would bring his dog-and-pony show to the googleplex and tell you how the perfs are done.

But I wasn't bitter, because I was working towards something, and I had a plan. I went out of my way to prove myself, work late hours, get noticed, and although my manager did make an effort to hire me on full time, it never happened, because it was never truly made a priority.

This doesn't mean 80-hour work weeks (at least in my end of the company), but you are expected to make goals and hold yourself to them -- and ideally deliver something that beats the rest of the industry while you're at it. Do not come to Google expecting a research environment, there's plenty of research going on, but if it's not in your 20% time you'd better have something to ship. I list this as a con only because I suspect this bit some of the people who rated Google negatively.  The company has grown really fast. This has caused some strain, both in terms of infrastructure and in communication. Many of the nooglers are fresh out of college, and the naivety cuts both ways: they're simultaneously over-eager to re-engineer everything in sight, and bitter when perks change or they don't get promoted fast (nevermind that it's still better than the rest of the industry -- they've never been there). With rapid growth comes a lack of focus, as well, with weird projects with no monetization story. (Caveat: I'm in Ads, where money matters.)  I get the impression that we've got our share of bad managers. My manager (and the two immediately above him) are all great -- technically sharp, caring, and happy to get their hands dirty. But I've heard horror stories from other teams, and you can read plenty of them on this site, I'm sure -- preference for low employee numbers, suckups and yes-men, etc. I suspect most of the thoroughly bitter people have gotten a bad manager and not requested a transfer out from under him/her.  On that note, Google does a bad job of handling underperformers. They try hard to help crappy engineers and managers improve, but at some point you've got to cut your losses -- a bad employee, particularly one with a bad attitude, is poison that eats away at morale. I've seen people go through two or more performance improvement plans before finally getting the much-needed axe.  Google also does a fair-to-middling job of handling *overperformers*. I've gotten a few spot bonuses for successful projects (which, to be fair, were tens of times larger than the bonuses I got at similarly-sized companies in the past), but the motivating effect of the Founder's Awards are gone. No matter how many millions of dollars you make the company, if you're not in LSE's pet segments, no Founder's Award for you -- it'll go to some guys in search or something. Google is done making millionaires -- for those of us who got who got here after the IPO, the only way we'll retire is a 401(k). Again, having worked in industry outside of Google, this makes me wistful but not angry. I don't expect other people to make me a millionare.

Product managers are there to work with engineers to direct the product, as their job is to know the customers and the marketplace and come up with a good direction for products. Because a lot of what the marketplace wants is illogical, engineers often argue with product management, and such behavior is part of what makes engineering a great place to be. You can actually have a significant impact on product direction.  Additionally, Google is very fair about how promotions work. The engineers who impress their colleagues get promoted. Those who don't impress their colleagues don't get promoted. Thus, most good engineers will get promoted. I've heard lots of people complain about this process, but usually I hear this from engineers who aren't that impressive. It could be that the explanation for *why* they aren't getting promoted isn't transparent enough...but I don't know.  In almost all situations, you are in control of your own destiny at Google. You set your own goals. You set your own timeline to achieve those goals. Management is there to guide you in setting these goals, but it is your duty to set good goals and strive to achieve them. This is also very empowering, and avoids the micromanagement that occurs at other companies.

More broadly, people there are so busy and so low on EQ, it is not a pleasant place to work.  The work is mind numbingly abusive. The caliber of projects I was given were on the level of things I did 5 or 10 years ago, and the volume of work was 2-3x what is reasonable if you don't want someone to work until 11pm every night. If you have any level of senior management experience, do not expect to develop and evolve your skill set, expect to be taken advantage of via over-work on basic projects.  They don't offer any management training or understand what good mid-level management looks like. Whether you want to develop as a manager or be managed well, odds are stacked against you. I've never seen so many bad managers in one company.  Beware the smoke and mirrors. There is an extraordinary PR narrative around the company due to it's stock price and Bezos' wealth. Behind the curtain, the company is not as good at data as it pretends to be, and their ""customer obsession"" is a thinly veiled metaphor for profit-seeking. (They do not understand or value real customer insights nor do they have they evolved much beyond their 1990's playbook of how personalization should work.)

I get that we have to pick 120 units per hour in order to get the orders out on time, but do you have to remind me every time my rate is low? Just leave me alone and let me do my job. Damn. And every time my rate was low, I always got mad at myself which made me focus on that rather than the task at hand. Also, I didn't like that they started ranking us from the picker with the highest rate to the picker with the lowest rate. Is this a competition?  TOT TOT stands for Time Off Task. They calculate TOT from the time you finish a pick to the next time you finish a pick, so if, for instance, you use the washroom. This will not only affect your rate, but your TOT, also. I get it. The less time you spend picking, the less productive you are. I didn't like that everything was timed. Maybe I'm a little salty because ultimately, TOT was what got me fired, but who's to know?  Short Lunch Break Another thing I didn't like was that the lunch break was too short. As a full timer you get a full 30 minute lunch break. FULL 30 MINUTES. Had to make sure the people in the back heard me. By the time I've used the washroom, checked my blood sugar and made my lunch, I have a FULL 15 MINUTES to eat and relax. I know that blood sugar part was personal, but still not enough time for a break. Bottom line, I think the break could've at least been 45 minutes.  Long Hours As a full timer, I worked from 5a.m. - 4:30p.m., with the exception of two 15 minute breaks, and a 30 minute break in which we had to clock in and out of. So, all in all I worked 10.5 hours. As you'd imagine, at the end of the day I'm exhausted and my feet hurt.  Physically Demanding This is a very physically demanding job. Depending on your schedule, you're on your feet for 5-10 hours. Plus, you have to bend, ascend and descend a latter (as as a full timer who's only 5'2"", I was on a ladder at least 50 times a day), push a cart and sometimes lift heavy grocery bags. As a picker, you have to move pretty fast. Combine that with being in ambient (it's 70 degrees in there) and you'd swear you're in a cardio class. I'd be sweating bullets in there. It was not pretty.  Having to Work in Different Temperatures Amazon fresh has three different picking areas: Chilled, Ambient and Frozen, however they combine these areas to make mixed batches: there's Chilled Ambient, Frozen Chilled and Frozen Ambient.

5442,Yes,Service,Male,3.0,6.0,54,62,Yes,13,13,"1. Amazon's organizational structure is incredibly frustrating. The DA position was created with no upward mobility in mind and as such it is almost impossible (and always time consuming) to move up in the company. Amazon makes employees interview multiple times in order to move beyond a certain level instead of just taking into account the strengths and skills of worthy people and promoting them. There are also so few positions available to so many talented people that almost no one who deserves a higher position gets one.  2. Amazon cares little for its Data Associates. DAs are grossly underpaid for the work that they do, especially when compared to other similar positions in any other company in the surrounding area. Amazon counts on their brand recognition to draw in workers instead of maintaining any kind of competitive compensation or benefits. The organization also promised very flexible hours when I first started but when I left they had done a complete 180 and cracked down on time sheets, instituting a very inflexible set hours structure. Employees were given no other benefits to compensate for the loss of flexibility.  3. Others are treated visibly better. DAs working in the same building as SDEs (or even seeing communications from other sites) can see how vastly inferior they are treated. SDEs are often provided catered lunch at events, larger salaries, and are treated with much more respect. DAs are often offered the leftovers from SDE events but cannot expect the same level of catering at their own events. They are made to obsessively time track to account for every single second of their day, whereas the SDEs are free to do as they wish.  4. The role of DA has changed dramatically overtime but no changes in pay, benefits, opportunity, or recognition have reflected this. The DA position was originally created to be a glorified button pusher, just entering in data with little critical thought. Now a high performing DA is expected to specialize in various complex work flows, organize small-to-mid level projects, communicate cross-site, be able to train others on various workflows, and develop new and up and coming projects. The wage has remained the same since the DA position was created though the position has become more of a workflow specialist or coordinator position. Upper level management seems to neither understand nor care for this, as the same compensation is still being offered, the job description remains the same, and DAs continue to be undervalued and underdeveloped.",Yes,No,2,0,Yes,No,[],Yes,Yes

My numbers are down and the have reduced the tools that we need to do our job (driver support). Not only is the pay equal to wal mart with the tease of becoming permanent employees, they treat their drivers like garbage. I leave daily so frustrated that I am simply a receptionist whose job it is to give the driver a bull crap speech, just to get them off the phones. I was cheated out of two hours of time off, and they used some Houdini mathematics to make me think that I was in the wrong. After speaking to the upper echelon, I honestly thought something would change. They expressed an interest in feed back, how to improve things, now... You can’t get anyone to say “f-off” to you.  The computer system they sent has had to be replaced once already, now this one is giving “chrome out of memory” on a daily basis. Tech support is as useless as a space heater in hell. My department is the dumping grounds for every call. Even customers get transferred to us, just so we can tell them they’ll have to call back because we can’t access customer files. Getting any sort of feedback on performance or ways to improve is impossible. The while burn and churn cycle at its best. It took me over an hour to get enough supervisor involvement to file an accident report. This was a rollover accident involving packages. The system rejected the report, even when a co worker tried to submit it. Even reaching out to a “DART LEAD” they had me filling out a form to get the driver terminated for physical violence. Payroll department will not read a message. Only rejects or closes the case based on what mood their in! No ability to call or reach out to other departments.

Like a lot of people have said, your breaks are more like 10 minutes and lunches are pretty short too. There's so many safety hazards that if someone from OSHA came in they'd have a heart attack. They purposely frown upon any bit of succor (sitting on ladder, sitting on the floor, etc) or breaks (bathroom breaks and normal timed breaks) that they'll get onto you about it. They literally want you to be a robot, and if not you will be fired or written up. Within my month in a half of working there, this is what I experienced,  When I was first hired I was very excited, and despite what people have said I wanted to be optimistic. I was originally trained to become a stower, but after 2 weeks I was switched to counter. There were many instances where the management seemed to pick on certain people to succeed, or to fail. I was one that they wanted to stay and I think the reason why is because I'm young and a fast worker. My coworker on the other hand that was older but able to follow the same pace as I. The entire time I saw management talk to him or about him they would either be giving a write up or a talking to despite us working the same pace (which was at the speed that they had told us they wanted). After that, all the older people that I had trained with were either getting write ups or quitting because the work was too much. Already, within the 2nd week they were weeding people out. It bothered me, but since they weren't focused on me I just kept doing my job.  Now, a month has passed and I'm getting sick of working here and it's showing. I have a very good work ethic so even when I do hate a job I will do my best no matter what and that's what I did. By this mark most of the people I trained with disappeared and one of the lasts was on his second write up. Peak season is also starting soon, and so everyone on that shift in the morning has to meet in the main break rooms. Its the usual 'be safe' meetings one can imagine, and they're playing videos to demonstrate, towards the end though is when things got.. Interesting. A video starts up and it's talking about our wages. The video then goes on to tell us that we're paid 12 an hour starting out and every 6 months we gain like 50 cents to a max of like 14 an hour I think. That's.. Not true. That's not true at all. I have a friend who's worked here for a year and a half and he's only paid 11.50. Everyone in the room is mumbling uncomfortably and the people giving the presentation don't even mention it and moved on the next video. After that they used this guilt trip tactic to tell this story on how a kid wanted a blue firetruck for his birthday, we messed up and gave him a red one and now his birthday was ruined. It's pathetic. That entire morning was a pathetic way to work even harder than what we already are working. They absolutely do not care about you and will not even bother learning your name and instead will call you sir or ma'am. Now for the conspiracy part.  To put it short, they hire anyone for 2 weeks, you mess up at all within those 2 weeks you're written up. When you're written up its already too late for you and they will purposely mess you over and get you to either quit or fire within that month. They hire people every day it seems so you're easily replaceable. Everyone is, including management. Everyone is for themselves and they will gladly mess the next person over to get in their numbers, They just repeat this formula over and over again and maybe, maybe if you're a very devoted person you'll stay.  I haven't even gone into the actual work of it which by itself is easy but at the pace they want it isn't. Out of the 3000+ bins I scanned as a counter I messed up 17 times, doing the math I messed up .56% and I was written up. They're that cut throat about it.

I think it's a great tool to know if the candidate is ready to take on the responsibility. Although, it would be nice if they were to use recommendation from current manager or processes you've successful implemented across all shifts within your department. - This may be a con to others but I was fine with addition responsibility. I was planning on applying for a high position which would require additional responsibilities and wanted to ensure I was up to the task. Management gave me a second department to run/supervise. The person who was running the other department was on a leave for quite sometime before he quit. During his leave, I was asked take on that department in his absence. When he quit, upper management decided since I was able to run 2 departments smoothly that his position would no longer exist and the position I had would absorb all the additional responsibly. You would technically run 2 different department, but still remain with the same pay.  - Con for others would also be working long hours and a lot of overtime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. - Amazon is metrics driven company and when interviewing most candidates I've noticed that more than half of my interviewers during my time at Amazon were liked mind in that sense. So although one may have amazing soft skills and will need that especially with dealing with associates if you weren't good at figuring out rate, production and volume (which is basic math and can be taught) your can fail your interview.

Work-life balance is something that the employee has to regularly put their foot down to enforce.  High density seating means engineers in those areas are not going to get stuff done. It's stupid, not frugal.  Legacy projects are left running in production long after everyone who has worked on them has left the company, with some unfortunate saps having to prop them back up every time they get paged, but without the authority to fix them so they are stable, since the next big thing is way too important. Maintenance tasks are not rewarded.  The product definition for the next big thing will change incessantly until it is finally launched long after it was promised, and after a long death march, during which several key people will have quit in disgust, and a few more will have been reassigned to another project that they had no interest in, but which had a lot of people quit in disgust. Don't worry though, that just means more work for everyone else, and a shorter on call rotation. And a lot of time interviewing people to try to replace the people who left.  Managers routinely lie to higher ups about the status of projects, so it becomes a crisis when someone finally notices things aren't going to be delivered on time.  Infrastructure and build tools are poorly maintained -- the teams are perpetually understaffed, like the rest of the company, and it results in productivity losses across the company, greater than the cost of just fully staffing those teams.  Between poor project management, poor product design, operational burden from slowly collapsing systems and poor development tools, so much time is wasted that it would be funny if you didn't care.  Compensation is ok, mostly. There is no gift-matching, which surprised me until I realized that Amazon has never donated anything to the community.

So many learning opportunities in this company and opportunities to make a difference at all levels. Despite being a larger company there is plenty of chance to be impactful whether you're in the field, in engineering, or sales and marketing roles. The rate of change in the business has been exponential over these past years and being part of that growth has been eye opening. The company tends to be pretty flat and really live its leadership principles. It's a very common theme for people to think they're just put up on a wall for people to read - but they're not - they really are interwoven into everything that people do. The customer obsession vs. competitor obsession is refreshing to someone like me who has spent a bunch of time in the tech industry. A generally humble company which is always looking to improve and do the right thing for customers. Also like the fact that nothing is beneath people in the company - a stark difference to other companies where ""execs"" are considered unapproachable and aloof. Most approachable group of senior execs I have ever encountered. When I left AWS I missed it intensely and was pleased to return.

They brag about how they got into their cushy positions because they stowed very high numbers, in reality, of course they did, when the company opened up in march or april, none of the kiva bins were full, they were EMPTY. Plus their quota was only 1800 and they stowed quite differently, now it's like 2500 or whatever they decide to make it. You go to stowe items and the bins are 90% full already, or the bar codes are missing.

Development is a term used only a couple of weeks prior to performance reviews. Development is not part of the company's DNA, nor is it a priority. For most companies, the talent is treated as if they are the most important resource to the company, but at Amazon we are treated as the Achilles heal that needs to be replaced by a system (hands off the wheel). Morale is exceptionally low, and people count down the days to fulfill their contract for their relocation package. It is a sink or swim environment, and the senior managers (I refuse to use the term leaders) encourage that type of environment to see which employees can survive. Amazon is a transactional company. It provides it's employees monetary compensation and it expects a certain service level. You will not read articles about Amazon's altruistic nature, you will not be encouraged to volunteer with the community, and even if you do have a 5 month old child you are expected to travel for the entire week without seeing them in order to meet with vendors. The prestige of working for an online power-house such as Amazon is not worth the loss of a personal life. Nights and weekends will be tarnished with the tinge of anxiety as emails, midnight deal flips, demand spikes, and pricing rules will forever require immediate attention. Jeff Bezos may state that recent articles do not reflect the company he is a part of.....and clearly he has not had to stay up to turn on a deal of the day offer at midnight and work thru the pricing issues for an extra two to three hours with the expectation of being back in office in a few hours.

The incentives are horrible. Pay is horrible for what we do. Pretty much do all the hard work to only get a simple thank you while all the higher ups get the bonuses and raises and praise. No opportunities here unless your buddy buddy with management. Hard work gets you no where. You can work hard for 2 years and still be in the same position.  They have a stupid saying there that one part says ""have fun"" there is NO fun here. You'll get yelled at if they see you trying to have fun. So rethink your logic Amazon. Upper management especially the OPS are horrible and a joke. For every one good manager or ops manager there are about 5-8 horrible ones. Which sucks too because the lower horrible managers get hired higher and just become more horrible but with more power. They only higher whoever is kissing their but. Not by hard work.  Manamgmet there does not act like management should. They walk around like they created amazon. Smug and arrogant is who they are there. They treat all the lower level employees like their garbage. Yet were the ones that make them look good. Pay is horrible. We work 10 hours to only receive a 30 min lunch. Not to mention there always on you for even a minute of being late after break. Yet they don't say anything when we have to walk 5 min just to get to the break room. Not to mention we actually have these jail sounds now at our facility. Telling us when our break is and telling us when to walk back (not even give a full 15 min break. By 12 it sounds and you need to walk back.)  You talk to one of your coworkers for a minute and get talked too by upper management. Yet if you ever see them. All they do is talk. BS. And just on there computers. Even here I've heard the OPS in Moval talk about clubs, girls, money, movies, people, ect. Like wth? Saw ops manager throw a ball to the wall for an hour straight. See them just chill in rooms and do nothing. Yet there the ones making more money and salaries. Lazy bums.  We don't get really anything here. You have to kiss the biggest butt and know them just to move up. Hard work gets you no where here. See people sweating and working so hard here. Yet it makes no sense. There is no raise. There is no extra bonus for hard work. Only extra is your just making managemen look good. Which shouldn't be. And let's say you do move up to PA. It's just another job your getting to little to be paid for yet your pretty much doing the managers jobs. Almost every job here is doing someone else's job. Problem solvers do most of the hard work. They are pretty much like supervisors. Yet we get paid and treated like anyone else. All they care is about numbers and volume. They don't care about accuracy. They don't care about efficiency. They'll bleed you dry towards the end of the day. And yell at you to keep working till the end of shift. Yet they don't do anything.  Honestly no pros for this company. It is just a company that pays the bills. Don't look for a career here. There is none. And if you think to just go to HR for all these things. Think again. They don't do anything. They will always favor management over anyone else. So even if your in the right. Don't count for anything. HR there is to scared to say anything. They have an open door policy which is garbage too. They do all this talk about you can always come to them. But not even 300 complaints about a managers or almost whatever it is you have a problem with will get resolved. HR there just like the management are jokes. Almost all them need to get rehired or retrained for a month because most either forgot or never got trained how to actually be management.  Once you start working here. All you will think about is the day you finally quit. It's one of those jobs that will make you day dream to when your finally out of there. Trust me. See the reviews here. And you can see how many places this is happening. Not just here in our warehouse. But everywhere. And if you do notice. Most of the good reviews are upper management. Yes of course their going to post good reviews. They don't do anything but get paid so well for that. I know I'm not alone in all this. A lot of people feel this way. Especially in my building.

9808,No,Product,Male,1.0,3.0,47,49,Yes,20,10,"- All those smart, driven people that they’re hiring? Every person who’s hired after you is your direct competition. The theory is that every new hire has to be better than the existing average (thus “raising the bar”), and this combined with high turnover and a stack-ranking employee review process means that the longer you stay, the more endangered your position becomes. Knowing how things work does not outweigh being “good on paper” and a new hire.   - Constant employee turnover. Our team lost its entire marketing department within a six-month period. Senior management blamed this on the team and decided to reorganize. And I’ve seen this happen to at least 3 other departments within 2½ years. It lowers employee morale and makes it incredibly difficult to get anything done, since no one has institutional knowledge extending farther than a year or two.   - Chaotic, undocumented, ever-changing processes. All that turnover plus an unhealthy insistence on new launches instead of maintenance & upkeep of existing products means that there is little to no documentation, and you’ll be lucky if you can track down someone who knows how the system is built. This means a lot of emergency trouble tickets and on-call drama for some teams, and a lot of headaches and finding workarounds for others.   - Managerial scapegoating at all levels. This can happen to entire divisions, as well as to individuals. If you are working here and having trouble fitting in, now is the time to evaluate your exit strategy.   - Capricious, poorly communicated, and barely-planned leadership decisions. For a data-driven company, almost all planning decisions seem to originate in the VP’s gut.   - No work-life balance. The only people who get ahead are the ones who ruin their health and sanity by spending all their time in the office. Then they burn out and have to take extended leaves of absence.   - Almost no promotion potential. Make no mistake -- they’re hiring externally for the higher-level positions. During the last round of reviews, out of a team of 200+ workers, 5 people rose one level. Mostly from level I to level II. Your raise, if you’re lucky, will be about 1%.   - Deceptive compensation messaging. You’re told that your “total compensation package” equals $X, but a good third of it is likely in RSUs that only vest after a long time with the company. Remember that employee turnover is such that most people don’t outlast a year or two -- so very few people are going to see the compensation advertised. Despite what they will tell you in the interview, it’s probably a good idea to evaluate the compensation on the base pay, because that’s mostly what you’ll be seeing. (Along with your signing bonus for the honeymoon period.)   - Short-term thinking. This is probably the root cause of all the lack of organization, capricious decision-making, and turnover. No one in the upper management is thinking beyond the next feature launch, the next organizational planning document, the next round of employee reviews. This may be standard in the tech world, but it almost certainly means that without some real investment in vision and strategy across the board, Amazon will be taken down by “the next big thing” when it shows up.",No,No,3,3,No,Yes,[],No,Yes

10425,No,Product,Male,2.0,4.0,38,45,Yes,20,20,"Amazon, like other big companies, will never present a uniform experience. Your experiences will depend on the team you join. There were a lot of people on my team who wanted nothing more than to get out but I have other friends who actually are fairly happy there. That said, there is some uniformity of the culture that has its origin in Bezos Darwinian worldview. The best advice I can give is to read the book The Everything Store as I think it nails the culture. Personally, I found it quite unpleasant. It is a harshly critical environment. Work environments that challenge you to be your best are great, but it seemed nearly pathological at Amazon. Anything I did was corrected by at least 4-5 people whether or not it merited it, partly so they could show off how they were *better* and partly because it's an ingrained part of the culture. One of the Amazon Principles are 'Are Right. A Lot'. I think the corollary to this is many Amazon employees think everyone else is always wrong and feel the need to constantly tell you. It gets pretty old fast. At first I took this personally and thought maybe I was just a screw up but when I started paying more attention I realized EVERYONE received this treatment.  Amazon is also the kind of place that will use you up and spit you out if you let it. I've worked at true start-ups in my twenties and put in hours that would put most of the folks even at Amazon to shame. In doing so, I learned what my limits were, how much of my life I was willing to sacrifice to work, and that ultimately I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. As such, I was well equipped to manage my work load and still be successful. I didn't work crazy hours or get too stressed out. But I saw those that had not had such an experience, and the often ended up worked into the ground because they didn't know how to draw the line at some point.  Lastly, Amazon is an extremely chaotic place. Many people who work there like to delude themselves into thinking it functions similarly to a start-up (anyone who has worked at a real start-up will immediately tell you it isn't really like one at all). The problem is, it's a huge company. And when a company exceeds a certain size, it *gasp* actually needs a bit more uniformity in process and coordinated long-term planning. Instead, Amazon makes pretensions to process but kind of lets teams do their own thing. Frequently, there is process, but it varies by team or if you actually use the 'official' process it just means you won't accomplish what you need to as you'll be mired in some dead-end path. The idea of being 'start-up like' like or 'scrappy' is wonderful in theory for such a big company, but in practice it just doesn't work. Amazon wasn't even particularly fast in pushing out new features, which is presumably the point of such an ethos.  Lastly, the comp really isn't that great. It's okay, but the benefits are mediocre at best, the base salaries are just average (I knew what a number of people were making from having discussed it) and much is locked up in stock that vests over years. It's basically a golden cage designed to keep people at the company despite how miserable most of them are.  And that's the thing I'd really impress on prospective hires, it was very rare I perceived anyone to be truly *happy* to be there. For my part, I did a year and got out. Not because it was unbearably difficult or the worst job ever, it just wasn't a particularly pleasant or rewarding place to be. I think if you know what you're getting into the cost/benefit is there, you get to see the company from the inside, work on big problems, and work with a ton of smart people.

HD seating means developers no longer get their own cubicles, we have to sit in large bullpens that contain a dozen or more people.

They say this problem will go away when the new buildings start coming online later in 2014, but they really need to just rent more space now. At the rate Amazon is growing, those new buildings will fill up with HD seating just as soon as they're built.  On a similar note about Amazon's growth: it feels like we're in a phase of runaway personnel growth. This means we can't hire front-line managers fast enough to keep up with the development team expansion, and the development teams are getting to large for their managers to handle. Also there are a lot of fairly new managers who really don't know what they are doing. This is resulting in lots of developers not getting the help they need to further their careers.  Software testing is one of those areas that comes into political favor, and goes out again in a couple of years. In some departments, this means the QA teams get absorbed into the development teams (and then those people get assigned developer work and pagers). In other departments, this means that the QA team just doesn't get headcount expansion to cover new teams and team expansion. But the QA team is still expected to do some kind of coverage of these expanded and new teams. This means nobody is happy with the QA teams. Developers are frustrated because QA isn't keeping up, and is stalling releases. Development managers are put upon to provide more headcount for QA, or otherwise close the gap.

There are too many managers and very few employees who do the actual work. Most people working there are impulsive, irritated and burnt out from overwork. It is not a family oriented company, work days are very long and stretch into weekends, one person’s work load normally equates to 2-3 people’s worth of workload, if someone complains about workload, they are told that everyone around here works 2-3 people’s worth of work, so go back and work harder. Eventually, everyone burns out and looks for better jobs elsewhere. This causes a constant churn of employees, new people are constantly being brought in and there’s never a stable team. Moreover, there is no recognition of employees. Even after delivering stuff, there is hardly any feeling of achievement because it is not attributed to employees and they are not recognized. Too many layers of managers who do nothing but micro manage their employees and play dirty politics. The annual review process is completely flawed, it favors connected and old timers over the new employee.

Benefits are run of the mill, nothing special and no real perks.  Amazon is also famously known for its high turnover. I remember on my first day at the new employee training, someone told me that the average person doesn't stay for more than 18 months. I now understand why (especially since I left exactly at the 18 month mark). Amazon works their employees hard (see aforementioned lean teams) and they're pretty nonapologetic for it. The feeling you get is that you should be lucky that you get to work there. Seeing as it is an extremely successful and highly respected corporation, I get it.

Just when you think you've made a difference by performing 15 different tasks to accomplish a goal (10 of which were not really yours to do, but you did them because there was no one else to pick it up), everything shifts in frequent re-orgs. Resources are lost, roadmaps change dramatically, documentation is poor to non-existent, which causes lost momentum that sucks the life out of you.  The lack of processes and routines. This is not true for 100% of the company, but is for many areas that one would think a company of 10+ years would have nailed. The constant reorganization of teams and leaders breaks any continuity that was established prior to the reorg. I was dumbfounded when I learned that a certain team in the company had absolutely no idea of the steps it took to issue a payment to a supplier. I think they thought it was all black magic. Project processes were another area that some key development teams made up as they went and changed quarterly. This created loads of knee-jerk reactions for many teams impacted across the company and challenged goodwill with internal relationships.  HR could care less about employees. Loads of lip service from the HR teams to make you think they care. Like many other groups in the company, their individual teams don't seem to talk to one another, or know each other for that matter. It is as if each team has blinders on and they only know and perform only their function in strict confines. There is lots of ""that's not my job"" attitudes. As an example, I witnessed on more than one occasion where great performers took international assignments only to return to leave the company because the company did nothing to help reintegrate the employees. What I heard is that HR managers and recruiters did nothing to assist these employees returning from their assignments, each one saying it was not their job. It was left to the employee to figure it out themselves. So after the company spends tens of thousands of dollars to move staff around the world yet the company expects nothing in return? How dumb is that?  Below market pay. Amazon is known for paying below market in terms of base salary yet expects people to work at least 50 hours per week. Many teams due to them being lean require 60+ hours a week. HR sells the entire compensation package with stock which can be great in a up market and if you live in the US. The odd thing is the mixed message they send with it: the stock makes you an owner of the company but because they call it comp, they expect you to sell each time you vest. I would rather have a larger base pay.  Amazon is no different than other companies in that it has it's own dysfunctions.

There is no A/C where you work. It gets so hot there. A/C only seems to be in the cafeteria and in the offices. No matter the position, the takt time is unrealistic and they put a lot of pressure on you to do over 100%. While working there I've had my takt time changed 3 times because they want us to do over 100%. Some people end up not doing their job properly because they are trying to hit their numbers and it ends up affecting your job. I and others have complained many times, but nothing gets done because to them productivity is the most important thing. Quality takes a back seat to quantity. You get two breaks one is an unpaid half hour and the other one is paid half hour, but with the paid break they don't want you leaving your station until one min before your break (even if you are far from the break room) and they want you back your station the minute the break is over. That means you have to leave before you break finishes. So if your station is a 5 min walk from the break room you end up losing 8-10 mins of your break. You are on your feet for 9.5 hours and that is long. I would never recommend working here to anyone. They don't know how to treat their workers.

Amazon is a place with infinite career choices for people who are committed to work hard and deliver results. It is a diverse and multicultural place where employees are heard, and where management really fights for everyone’s best experience. Employees are asked a daily question which helps management to build mechanisms to tackle problems/barriers for employees, there are GEMBA boards where employees can express any urgent concerns and management works on them in a weekly basis, and the job itself is demanding but very rewarding. TRMS is only for professional people who are committed to help on Amazon’s innovation and keep the platform safe from malicious attacks. TRMS just got a new site leader who is really working hard to improve the employee experience. Management overall is very humanitarian, flexible and willing to help employees grow. All managers have their own success story, some of them started working in lower levels inside the company, which shows that hard work really pays off. High performers with great leadership skills are able to be automatically promoted to Sr. Investigator after one year in the company, which is something I have not seen in any other department or company. These promotions are made in a quarterly basis. There is a recognition program for overtime and high performance which provides employees Amazon Gifcards in Euros, which can add up for a very good sum of money at the end of the month. Dogs are allowed in the office, transportation is paid by Amazon, there are relax areas, games, 2 parties per year, fun activities, committees for women, sexual diversity, and groups for social help.

On top of this, the work you’ll do for Amazon is actually more demanding than finance because you’ll be doing work that is incredibly physically exhausting, and will probably spend all of your off days lying in bed trying to get your energy back.  -Opportunities to enhance your income and salary through promotion pale greatly compared to other industries and companies. There are both less openings for advancement, and the jump in compensation you’ll see when promoted will typically be lesser than that of other companies.  -Annual salary raises for employees that meet or even exceed expectations are pitiful and are less than inflation (<1.5% Outstanding performers are only bumped 2.0%). The promotion to Sr. Operations manager (which is a big deal to the company) only consists of a ~5% base salary increase from the starting Pathways salary. This makes the in-line-with-industry offer that Pathways starts you at feel like it is really just to get you in the door.  -This is NOT a typical post-MBA role. Business acumen and overall intelligence and value to the business mean nothing in this role and is not valued at all - the role is really all about relentlessly barking down orders to your team in order to ‘drive’ improvements to the limited scope of metrics that your SOM silo’s you into, often at the expense of the well being of other people or the operation at large. You’ll also get sick of people using the word ‘drive’ all the time and feel a slight urge to throw someone under a bus every time you hear it.  -Due to the secluded and low SES location of most fulfillment centers, you’ll have limited opportunity to develop relationships with other young post MBA professionals and expand your professional network. Completely forget happy hours or meeting colleagues or friends for dinner after work. In fact, completely forget being able to do ANYTHING after work, because as I mentioned above you will be so physically exhausted.  -All businesses have office politics, but due to the unreasonable metrics pressure that everyone from all areas is constantly under, the office politics game at Amazon is particularly shameful and terrible, with political capital being used or gain to get or give assistance with trying to help someone else out with their metrics constantly.  -Expect to get minimal or no support from your peers, manager, or HR.  -While the rest of the world is enjoying the Christmas and holiday season (Peak at Amazon) you will be working 6 days / week, 12-15 hours / day and your life will be worse than hell.  -The illogical interactions and senseless gibberish you’ll be slammed with - particularly by the hourly associates - but perhaps unexpectedly by many of the other AMs and OMs, your boss, and, god forbid, even the GM, will make it seem preferable to be instead sticking hot needles into your eyeballs.  Overall, as you can see, there are many more negatives to this job than positives.

One man was even running (literally running) to keep up with his picks. You are apparently monitored constantly so they know how many picks you are doing (even though I stayed in the toilets for over an hour and nothing was said to me from management or agency rep). Other jobs in the warehouse seemed more relaxed but I suspect the lucky few who had these jobs were permanent staff. Fact is, if you are a Christmas temp, expect to be treated like a robot and have very high targets if you are a picker or packer.  -Management will give you a pep talk at the beginning of the shift. I don't know if they still do this but the whole thing was pointless and just wasted time. The only time management seemed to communicate to us temporary staff was in this 10 minute talk and at 6am in a cold warehouse, I didn't want to stand there and hear them bang on about targets every shift.  -If you clock in a minute late, 30 minutes or an hour pay will be deducted. It sounds like a trivial thing, just don't be late for work right? Wrong. When you have a lack of these clock in machines which there was at the time, you could be standing in queues for quite a while. The whole thing was ridiculous.  There are other issues with this place but I'm going to keep these short.  -A lot of pickers didn't speak English. It wasn't a huge problem because well, if you are a picker, you won't get to speak to people much anyway. But if you need to communicate to other pickers for what ever reason, this can be a problem.  -Smoking cage was too small. We were discouraged from going completely out of the building to smoke but I had enough of being crammed in like an animal so eventually I had taken to the street to smoke.  - Airport security. I know how important security is for different reasons but the fact it takes at least 10 minutes off of your break just to get out of the warehouse is a joke. If you get an hour break, expect that to be 45 minutes by the time you get out of the there.  -Agent reps are useless. I asked to be changed to the late or night shift because it was very hard for me to get to work doing the morning shift. I had to rely on my mum (yep that's right, my dear old mum) to get out of bed at 5am every day to give me a lift to work because I haven't got a car and buses wouldn't have it me there on time. I had initially asked for nights and then they forced me to do the 6am start shift. They said they will be sorting transportation but that had taken more than a month which by that time, I had enough of the whole company and agency.  -In the 2012, they sacked a lot of people by text. Literally it was like 'we don't need you anymore'. Lovely ay? I was not one of those people, I had decided to leave about a week before this happened but my brother was also working there at the time and told me this was happening.  -Also it's a legal requirement that water may be available for staff. Hmm the water was available but no paper cups. So no cups, no water.

The only option here is not to show any brain / self analytical ability: every deviation from the commandments is a true tabu for the Holy Inquisition.

You are basically expected to work weekends often, and it is assumed that you will join late night calls every day. * On Call. If you're interviewing with them, ask them about it. They generally don't mention it to you till you've joined. Your mobile number is entered into the system, and anytime there is an issue in production, you will get a message and you are expected to login and take a look within 15 mins. This could happen anytime while you are on-call, 3am or when you are with friends on weekends... Oh, they'll give you a datacard though, so you can carry your laptop wherever you go and login and work when they ask you to. One thing that makes it slightly better is that the team takes it in turns, so you are on-call about one week every month (will vary by team size and other factors). * Absolutely no respect for personal space. I was called 8 times from office (about work) when I had explicitly told them I was out of office attending a funeral.

The working environment in Slough is down right unpleasant, over-cramped and dirty offices based in a down at heel area of town. The brand name is clearly able to attract some very smart people all hoping to get on the gravy train, but as the business has grown, the culture has become less friendly. Tenured employees are not appreciated and employees in general are entirely disposable. I have never worked with so many people that will happily stab each other in the back (or front) to get ahead. There is no fostering of team spirit or taking a genuine interest in people. No-one seems to have any life outside of work or take any interest in each other as individuals. There is absolutely no investment in talent management, talent development, or CSR. I find this unbelievable in a company the size of Amazon. The HR department contains the most useless group of individuals I have encountered, who seem to do little more than help manage people out of the business.  To survive at Amazon (and that is what you'll do... survive) you have to become an unquestioning drone, happy to work all the hours and meet all the demands on earth without reward or positive feedback. I find it hilarious the one of the leadership principles is 'disagree and commit', however doing so will get your card marked. I also find it hilarious that one of Amazon's 'peculiar ways' (of which there are many), is too not come across like the corporate borg. This place is more like the corporate borg than anywhere I have worked. Regimented leadership principles that you have to adhere to. Don't let wearing casual clothes to work fool you that you'll be playing table football in your lunch hour. 1. You wont get a lunch hour because the business is too frugal (tight) to hire enough staff. 2. There is nowhere to eat your lunch other than your desk, because the deli handling nine floors of employees is tiny. 3. Should you be able to get out for lunch, you have the delights of Slough high street to contend with.  I think the thing that is most depressing, is that the business is doing extremely well in these uncertain times, and yet there is no celebration of this, no lightheartedness, no fun. Just a relentless drive for growth with people under ridiculous amounts of pressure, trampling over each other to get ahead and sticking to cliques in order to survive. It's depressing that people have to act in such a selfish manner to succeed, and depressing to think that you have to abandon your principles to stay afloat..  It is easy to get sucked into the business and try and meet the ridiculous expectations and pressure you will be placed under, but the business can suck you dry if you let it, and spit you out without a thought.

The culture is very introspective and dedicated to self-improvement, if it were the same company it had been in 2009, I wouldn't still be there. Everytime I think I might leave, a new awesome project comes up that keeps me around. Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions. In many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now. We have more tools, resources, and knowledgeable people at our disposal, which compensates to some degree for the increased bureaucracy you see in some parts of the company. We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value. Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives. That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies. Especially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up. You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas. The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so, management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies. When joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of ""bootcamp"" which means you'll have an informed choice. It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process. One of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work.

They are an accurate cross-section of experiences that show the reality of working at Netflix and how entirely it depends on your manager, or who gets fired or promoted and suddenly becomes your manager. You will have zero life outside of work, and even if you are someone who could never imagine being considered anything other than a top performer, let alone getting fired, recognize that you--yes, you--will very likely be let go abruptly within your first year--sometimes in a matter of weeks--with no opportunity to improve, at the sole discretion of your manager, who him/herself may or may not be competent or honest. Be sure that you can afford to live in whichever very expensive city you are relocating to with no income, and are willing to explain a firing in your next job search. Political backstabbing is the order of the day. The meeting culture is horrendous and symptomatic of an organization that is growing too rapidly and clutching desperately to a culture that doesn't scale. Ask anyone who has been at Netflix in a leadership or cross-functional position and they will tell you that they spend their entire day in meetings, and then spend all of their nights and weekends at home trying to actually get work done. And finally, if you do survive beyond the first year, don't expect pay progression.

Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this.  -You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them.

In the nine days I was there for training before being unfairly dismissed, I saw several examples of employees being treated like children and unreasonably scolded. One girl was in the classroom 5 minutes before break was over. She suddenly had a bathroom emergency, so she left quickly to take care of it. She made it back just as they were shutting the door. On the next break, she was taken aside by the supervisor (supe) who said, ""I noticed you made it back from break just as I was shutting the door. I just wanted to let you know that's unacceptable. You need to be back from break several minutes early."" (In other words, you really don't get your full break.) She apologized, saying she'd been there five minutes early but had an emergency. He said, ""I'm sure it won't happen again.""  One girl had to call in sick because her child gave her the flu. They forced her to speak to three different people who scolded her, the last of which was the call center manager himself! He said he was going to give her the opportunity to come in for the rest of the week.  Another girl simply asked her neighbor for a pen during class. She was pulled into a conference room afterward and told by two different supes that talking during class was unacceptable and wouldn't be tolerated.  Netflix has a zero-tolerance policy for what they call ""push back"". They touched on this very briefly in class during our second week of training. The example they gave was this: ""If your supe tells you to change something and you say, 'I don't feel like it, so I'm not going to', that's considered push back and will not be tolerated."" Basically, it's outright insubordination. My supe said I needed to work on verifying every account. When people call in, their account auto-pops onscreen....unless they don't give their service code to the automated answering service before they're transferred to a live person. This happens about half the time and it's mostly people who don't have accounts and are just asking about the service. So I asked my supe, ""Is that even when they're just calling with a general question about the website?"" He said we needed to at least ask for a name and warned me that what I'd just said was considered push back but he'd let it slide this time. I was baffled but just said, ""Okay."" The same supe told me he liked that I was resolution oriented because that was a good thing. An hour later, he took it back saying it was bad and I needed to focus on empathy. When I was let go, they gave me the opportunity to give feedback. I mentioned the contradictions I'd noticed and also that I didn't understand how asking a simple question during training was considered ""push back"". I was told that it's all about perception and I just wasn't a right fit. They also said this sort of thing happens often.

16635,No,Service,Female,2.0,4.0,40,38,Yes,16,8,"The Dangling Carrot - The work to pay balance isn't right. You're expected to help multiple customers at once, talk about ALL Apple Services and Store Programs with every customer, help them quicker and quicker and constantly be in a high stress environment that makes the higher than average pay mean next to nothing when you realize you're doing the work of 2 to 3 employees - Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and staffs it's stores like it may be going out of business any day now. Customers regularly wait 20-30+ minutes just to get the opportunity to talk to someone to buy something. This can even happen if the person knows exactly what they want, has no questions, and is ready to pay. That stress is directly put on you as leadership hides behind an iPad or in an office but tells you to work faster from afar. - Apple's goal is to positively impact humanity but they seem to forget their own employees are part of that humanity. Your career ambitions are ignored, favoritism is rampant, they put more and more pressure on their people while giving them less and less resources to deal with it. - Their promotion practice is hidden and vague so that they can always make up excuses about why you aren't ready to get promoted. There are no clear metrics or avenues for job growth just management preference and their favorites are forced to the front of the queue while much more capable and deserving team members are passed over. When you're told you're not able to interview for a new position or promotion they make up reasons like ""what books are your currently reading about self development?"" or other vague open ended questions that have no right answer because whatever you say they will tell you its not good enough. -It is a regular practice that they will handpick people for promotions, interview them, and give them the job before they even let the team know the job is available. The day the job is posted is the same day they tell the staff someone already got the position. It's ok that they choose who they think is ready for promotion but the hidden nature of the process makes it look like under the table deals and favoritism is the only way to get ahead. - Apple has the clout to hire managers etc from outside of the company in a job role far below their last job. This means department store general managers and district managers are regularly hired as entry level managers at Apple (2 to 3 steps below their past position at their prior job). This makes an impossible void for anyone internally to get promoted to management. You're essentially shown that you need to be able to run 8-12 stores on your own before you can be moved up to be a basic manager at Apple. They give no opportunity for people to exhibit these skills internally so there will always be a very large divide between what they expect and what they allow internal candidates to show the competency for. This means that you're far more likely to move up at Apple by leaving the company, getting promoted elsewhere, and then coming back several years later to take a step down in role when you return. - Managers do very little to support the sales floor and technicians throughout the day. They blindly stand around and wait for issues to escalate before they step in.... in the meantime they are online buying sneakers, sitting in a closed door office drinking coffee, or having meetings that have no purpose while the rest of the staff handles the pressure of the day.",No,No,3,4,No,No,[],No,No

If you are anywhere in the administrative side all I can tell you is run away! They hire very incompetent upper management who create a horrible work culture. It takes you at least 30 days to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist in Austin and if you ask them why it's because they are full of the Apple employees who are trying not to lose their minds! Even the doctors on campus will admit that they can't believe the amount of employees who suffer chronic stress issues because of the work culture.  My advice is simple, if you have ambition and seek to grow in a successful career, run as far as you can from Apple. If you are a more relaxed person who only cares about getting a paycheck maybe you should consider it.  This is the type of place that makes you regret getting a promotion. Every time you go up the latter you are exposed to more and more incompetence until you want to throw your iMac out the window!  There is no respect for employees, no effort in providing what is needed for the job they ask you to do. Everyone is expected to deal with enormous amounts of ambiguity simply because they don't want to spend the money on clarifying anything. The internal tools are by far the worst I have had to use. Your hair will fall as the system crashes constantly and management refuses to spend the money on decent software. While I was an hourly employee we had to use a software to punch in and out except the tool would always break when you were trying to leave. It still baffles me how a company with as much money as Apple treats their employees as second class citizens compared to their customers.  I regret spending just under 4 years of my career in this madhouse. Bragging rights are not worth it! Keep your barista job along with your sanity.

Speaking from a retail perspective, many employees in the past were experienced working professionals who had deep knowledge in their respective fields be it photography, audio engineering, or filmmaking. What an employee lacked in knowledge or for upcoming software changes, Apple management and department leads made sure you were given ample development time to grow and learn. The structure then was unofficially to inspire your customers, and the sales will follow.  As time progressed, Apple leadership put more emphasis on ""people leaders"" who had poor knowledge of the product. As such, many of these new ""people leaders"" brought in from companies like Starbucks, Best Buy, Target, etc. didn't and still don’t share those same values as their passionate employees. Over time, the professionals working for the company became burned out and moved on, either by their own accord or a manager's. To fill the places of these working professionals were employees with no professional background, given little practical training on the software they were to learn resulting in having employees with poor knowledge on the product or subject if questions arose. The Apple professionals remaining in the company became complacent and/or bitter that they were being paid similar amounts as those newer employees with lesser experience, yet they were expected to assist with their deeper knowledge when a customer required it. This effect cause these professionals to exploit Apple's attendance policies resulting in less staff during a planned out day. A great example is seeing the Genius Bar become so famously behind. A lot of that is due to staff calling out for their shifts leaving their peers and lower ranking employees to pick up the pieces and learn-on-the-fly. When these problematic staff members were set to be confronted, they'd go out on leave-of-absence through stress or some sort of injury and return once the dust settles on their attendance record. This is a very deep problem Apple has yet to permanently resolve today.    What has since become noticed and evident is how most of Apple’s newest leaders are not inspirational tech professionals. They don’t develop you to want to use the platform or software. They weren’t promoted through the ranks, but were rather hired outside the company and brought in. They’re most interested in taking you through leadership development for a few months at your same rate then throwing you back into your old responsibilities with little to show for what you’d learned. The bulk of their leaders don’t even know how to use a word processor, build a spreadsheet, or even edit a photo. They’re there to coach on sales, inspire performance, and defuse customer escalations (overriding whatever fair resolution you had positioned to your customer). It’s not the Apple environment it once was, and has slowly gravitated into a sales organization first.

For example, you can be hired as a Chat Advisor, but if the need permits, you'll end up on the phones. Another example is, you can be working on night shift, but then end up on day shift if the need permits. Nothing is set in stone. You can be moved around or changed to go somewhere else at any moment. Apple does not care how it affects you.  ONGOING TRAINING WITH NO PAY INCREASES You will get hired for one thing.. but you will be crossed trained for everything else. They're goal is to have all Advisors knowledgeable about all products. They want everyone to be able to float around and provide support anywhere needed. I had been working two months on my own and my stats were horrible. I was still trying to get familiar with what I was trained to do. However, despite my lack of knowledge and ongoing horrible stats which clearly showed I was not ready to take on new products, they trained me on two other products within a month of each other. I did not receive a pay increase. I was totally stressed out and was about to quit several times. I expressed my anxiety to my manager but they were not able to assist me.  MANAGERS ARE PUPPETS I have nothing bad to say about managers other than I feel so sorry for them. You can tell they really want to do something different other than what their superiors are advising them to do. There is ALOT of pressure on them. Their managers are pressing them to get this done by this date with each member on their team. Most of the time when you take a problem to them, they will not hear you out. They will only make excuses as to why something is the way it is. I really do believe that is how they're trained. So I don't blame them. Don't expect your manager to be able to assist you with much. They are not trained to do that. They are trained to protect the brand - which ultimately means, if its not affecting the customer, they really do not care. The only thing they are concerned about is your stats. Anything outside of that they really don't care about.  YOU WILL DREAD LAUNCHES Launches are suppose to be a exciting time, but if the customers you support are directly affected by the launches, you will eventually hate them. I hate whenever Apple launches anything new. Although they test and test and test the product/software, it never works straight out of the box. Apple is a industry giant, but when it comes to product releases, I have yet to experience one that went smooth. Customers go absolutely nuts. Business owners scream at you, curse you and all kinds of things. Its terrible! iTunes and other non-technical departments do not have to deal with launches.  STATS WILL KILL YOU I really don't want to get much into this, but I will say this: It is very hard to have good stats. A customer can chat in, you help them, chat back in and the next person don't help them - the customer gets YOUR survey and mark it negatively based on what the other Advisor did. The customer can chat with you, you send them to the Apple Store, they have a bad experience at the store.. but then use the survey from their interaction with YOU and complain about their store experience. Yes, you can get penalized for what someone else did. I understand how this could happen, but there should be a way for the managers to correct this. The reason this is so important is because this affects promotions, salaries, EVERYTHING!! Currently there is no way to move a survey to the correct person that the customer is complaining about. If its your survey then its your negative mark even if the customer was not complaining about you.  THE STUCK SYNDROME Because Apple offers such a good pay and good benefits/perks, if you decide that you hate working for Apple, but you don't have a degree or experience to be able to leave the company and find a job that will pay you the same, you'll be stuck. This is exactly what has happened to me. Since working for Apple, I have moved and purchased a car. I thought this was my dream job and that I would retire from here one day. Now I wish I had not purchased anything or moved. That way, I could have at least found another job - still moved and purchased a car based on that income.  When it comes to Apple, please give yourself at least 6 months to a year before making any major life-changing decisions. This will give you enough time to decide if this is a place you can tolerate or even thrive in. For me, it isn't. I'm job hunting as I work.",No,No,4,6,No,Yes,[],Yes,No

Yes it's retail but the company likes to use ""work life balance"" as a key positive for working for Apple Retail when that is not so. Often full time employees are scheduled Fri, Sat & Sunday and thus miss time with their families/significant others and you can see that this wears on them.  - No clear path to promotion. Being excellent at your current role doesn't actually mean anything if management feels that you are not ""apple"" enough. This means people that kiss managements behind move up whether they are actually skilled or walk the walk vs talking about how great it is to perform a certain best practice and then ignoring that themselves.  - HR from corp. was brought in for a specific store and this feedback was given to them by over 20 people however no changes were seen as a result of this.

Don't get me wrong, Google and Facebook (as well as a few other notable Silicon Valley corporations) have extremely high standards when it comes to design and user experience, but Apple takes it to a whole new level. They treat designers like royalty, and it shows in the products. As a software designer, I do feel highly valued at Apple. I do feel that I am doing great work. I do feel that I am more of an artist, a craftsman, than a developer. And I do feel that the long working hours pay off, not in cash but in the ability to look at the work I've done with my team and think to myself that this is what Picasso would use today. That's priceless. The 'climbing a ladder for prestigious positions' doesn't exist here because that's not what Apple stands for. The workers are here to design beautiful products together, and if everyone competes for meaningless position titles, the product quality worsens.

They're really great as favors for friends/family who have jobs that pay more than yours. - Management is extremely skilled at giving you the runaround (also known as Feedback) when it comes time for promotion or a lateral shift in positions. Interviews either end up going cold with no response, or some ""surprise star candidate"" will swoop out of nowhere to take the position you desire so dearly. - Glass ceiling. Extremely little room for advancement. Someone has to either die or get fired for a spot to open up. There are pretty much 2-3 positions you can move into before ""management' is the next step, where you get a nice little raise to get yelled at by more customers and deal with disgruntled employees who have no future. - Resume killer. Once you've spent enough time in retail, you're essentially silo-ing yourself into that industry. Recruiters will see your experience as retail and generalize you as a retail salesperson, despite your own perception that you do not work at Macy's, Best Buy, Urban Outfitters, etc. If retail is your career choice, you're in the right place. If it isn't, you're screwing yourself. - Methodologies to provide customers with ""options"" for service are really just an euphemism for coercing the customer to conform to the workflow that Apple has set out. You are taught to repeat the same ""option"" repeatedly until the customer gives up, and agrees with you. That is NOT successful negotiation. It's not truly a choice if you can only provide the option to take it or leave it. That is called communism/socialism/totalitarianism. (ps. This is America.) - False perception of creativity. Apple positions itself as a company that breeds creativity. Truth be told, the retail store is merely a delivery mechanism for distributing products. As an employee, you have no impact on product development, processes, etc. You are merely a drone whose role is to hand customers product with a smile and collect payment.

If i feel someone shouldnt have to pay for something, or they've been treated badly before and it isn't right, then I can talk to the manager and for the most part he/she will agree with me. I love having that power to truly help someone. Along similar lines, is that you aren't trying to sell someone something they don't want, so you can be completely straight forward and honest. Say hey these are the great things about this computer, but if you personally don't feel justified for spending this much money? Then go somewhere else and buy another computer if thats what you prefer, theres no difference for me.

I was even told by my manager that we had to start hiring people who used Dells and owned an iPod because ""we had exhausted all possible routes"" to find other Mac users who would be interested in working in the retail stores. This was completely bogus because I know tons of people who use Macs and don't work at Apple.  The recent employees hired and the management are all wrong for Apple. My management even started distancing the true Mac users, like me, from working there. Despite my full time availability, I was only given about 10-16 hours per week right before I left. I was also told that other people would receive full time before me, even though I had been there longer than the other person being considered. Talk about no motivation.  Everyone also felt extremely overworked and underpaid. The raises were completely arbitrary, and the new hires weren't trained to sell Macs, just iPods and iPhones, so there were still the same number of people to help people who wanted to buy Macs, which just weren't enough.

21090,Yes,Service,Female,2.0,4.0,35,30,Yes,6,5,"Let me start by saying that the position has very little enterprise left in it due to the fact that Apple is making very little money from their professional products and some of them have been discontinued/phased out or replaced with their consumer counterpart. This is a glorified consumer support nowadays, with ALL the implications of it. I would not be surprised if they will outsource it too.  When I started, we were supposed to support Pro apps/servers/SOHO integration. By the end of the first year, 1 pro app was discontinued, the other two had very little call volume (meaning that only people using them privately knew how to support them), training for servers was left to people's goodwill (or naivety, depending on the point of view) since apple did not care about their servers and SOHO was a sorry joke about assisting old people resetting their routers. If you have any skills, this position is a slap in the face, if not an hindrance to your career. Unsurprisingly, by the end of my second year, 94% of my team of 15 people had been replaced with much less skilled advisors, which are also payed less.  During the week, 90% of your daily activity at apple will be trying to ""convince"" people with blocked phones that the consumer- hostile policy you are trying to push their way makes sense, all the while repeating nonsensical pre-written statements about how happy you are the customer is using apple. And don't forget to ALIGN! whatever that means. You work on Saturday/Sunday for no reason, since the kind of service does not require availability, and you get maximum two calls (about locked phones). Enjoy sitting there for hours doing nothing on the weekend.  Nowadays, it is just call after call from angry people forcefully transferred by the outsourced t1, which uses every possible excuse to transfer enraged people your way, just to avoid getting a bad survey.  The training provided is cheap, in particular after the few experts have been forced to leave, and also totally for your own development useless you want to stay in that same position your entire life. You can get their certifications but you will not really be able to use them outside of apple. You should really put all your efforts into taking a couple more expensive certifications from other vendors and then just leave.  Due to the fact that many people are buying into the rationale that being part of a big company gives them prestige or personal value, apple will always have a cohort of drones ready to replace the ones that open their eyes and leave. Having some sort of public persona (like being part of some public organization or organizing public events) will boost your career incredibly, since apple will be able to put their hat on it, while doing 0 for it. In that case, you will be promoted as soon as it is technically possible, which means 6 months. As a consequence, career paths are 100% reliant on your social skills and 0 or your actual skills/work ethic. It has become a recurring joke with one of my ex colleagues (an engineer) which applied to a position, only to have a guy flipping burgers in mcDonalds being hired instead of him.  The people working there are among the worst I have ever met. Cronyism is rampant, with people referring relatives/friends and then giving each others kudos in the end of the year review or abusing the WOW, to boost their stats and be promoted.  Some will go out of their way to downplay others, quite often starting real wars between teams to either make themselves look better or to diminish other people's results. Managers using WhatsApp to discuss work related matters.  Team nights were relatives/partners are invited.  One thing I have never seen anywhere else that often happens in apple is that someone will make up an issue and its solution, and then go around advertising the fake issue as the most important and critical of all. Then of course they come up with the solution and they get credited by their managers, which are not going to waste time trying to double check facts.  Some other people have built their careers by rewriting public facing articles in the internal wiki and ""selling"" them as their own original work to their managers.  Unless you want to live in Cork, which is a nice city but does not offer much, you can only work from home. If you work from home, your career chance reaches negative values. You are going to be cut off from any social activity and be checked for every action. There is no way for you to be moved to the office unless you move to another department, which will not consider your application unless you are already in Cork. Just don't do it.  Any kind of criticism is heresy and will turn you into an outcast.  The salary is lower than the market average, which they try to even out by giving you a discount on their product every 3 years and a couple of shares every year.  One of their benefits should be paying for your training/certifications, but they only pay you Apple certifications from Pearsonvue, which they later do not allow you to have on your personal account, so keep that piece of paper safe since there is no way to get a duplicate or a link to it.  They will use leftovers from the kitchen to have ""free food"" events for employees. Enjoy your diarrhea. The food is expensive and the quality is poor.

I have over 10 years of employment history in the IT industry and I never had any grieviences with management until joining this particular Apple Retail Store. Very negative and very condesending attitude from some managers in particular here at this store. Management offer ZERO support and are very quick to threaten employees with formal warnings of ""disiplinary action"" for those of us that dont meet the targets of serving at the minimum of 6 customers per hour for technical support at the Genius Bar. Good technical ability and customer service is not valued or appreciated by management. They only care about how many customers we can see per day. We are lucky to have enough time to even ask a customer their name here. There are NO breaks here. Just a lunch break midway through a 9 hour shift. There is ONE toilet that serves the entire store of approx 140 employees!!!! If any of the Genuis bar staff are more than 30 seconds away from the Genius Bar, management immediately start hounding then over the instore radios asking ""Anybody have eyes on...(employee name)"" Anyone who dares to stand up to or to question management here is bullied and hounded until they finally leave the store (and MANY end up leaving this particular store) Working conditions: The is virtually NO air conditioning at this store. The heat is unbearable working here, even in winter. Wearing apple shirts is mandatory but each employee is given just 2 t-shirts (1 long sleeve and 1 short sleeve) This is not sufficient as we need to change/wash these daily due to all the perspiration in the unbearable heat in this store. Several coworkers here also use bully tactics. They are 2 faced and like to send nasty emails to management with ""feedback"" on new employees in particular. The only company i have worked in where it is ""mandatory"" to attend ""out of store social events"" These occur several times per year and any employees who dont attend receive an ""attendance occurance"" (its classed as being the same as calling in sick due to illness). We are expected to attend these even if they are scheduled on our day off....

24575,Yes,Service,Female,2.0,4.0,48,71,Yes,16,12,"•Set your boundaries on DAY 1. I don't mean the day you start, I mean DAY 1, in the interview loop. It depends on the manager and the team, but unless you want to work 24/7, you better tell them you value your work/life balance and that you don't check mail outside of business hours (of course there are exceptions). Most importantly, STICK TO THOSE BOUNDARIES when you've accepted the offer letter, and you're in the position. One reply from you on a Saturday or Sunday, means they'll always expect a weekend response. The same goes for vacation. Unless there is an emergency, vacation is to get AWAY from work. Do not respond to your email on vacation, or the cycle will continue.  • Any support (admin) position, no matter what company or team, depends on the relationship between the admin and the manager. When your manager is laid off - the person who interviewed you, offered you the job, the person you MUTUALLY chose to work with, the person you've bonded with, built a strong relationship with, automatically know you both have each other's support - is gone. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other managers in the group that they'll shove you under. To be moved to a completely new manager, unwillingly (on both sides) has happened to me several times. At the time, if you hadn't been in a position for a year, you had to request permission from your manager to interview (they've recently gotten rid of that rule, but not in time for me to be laid off). If you decided to request permission, that automatically put a target on your back - so I was stuck until I was finally laid off.  •The pay for admins is lower than most companies, but the benefits do help take the sting out of that.  •Admins are always last on the list for raises. Yes, if you have a good review, you will get a raise. But it won't be very much.  •Yes, you'll work your butt off, some weeks will be crazy and other weeks you'll be twiddling your thumbs. Admin positions are hourly at Microsoft, which is actually an advantage because they get paid OT (time+1/2). However, during the ""slow weeks"", you shouldn't be penalized on your paycheck because there wasn't 40 hours worth of work to do. If your boss says ""why don't you go ahead and take the afternoon off, it's dead"", I'd take the afternoon off! If I needed the full 40 due to financial reasons, I'd make up things to do. That's a waste of my time and the company doesn't benefit either.  •There's definitely been a climate change since Satya took over. The Gates days were the good ol' days, the Ballmer days weren't as great, but still good - I don't have the confidence in Satya to lead Microsoft to success. We used to be and could be again, the best of the best! But I've seen Satya makes one bad decision after another, after another...  • Every team is on pins and needles wondering who will be next on the chopping block. Morale is the lowest I've ever seen it. Something needs to change and revive what we used to be - Microsoft - a company I was always proud to say I worked for. Until now.  •Due to the ""climate change"", you have to look out for you. You'll be back stabbed, stepped on, thrown under the bus. Especially if you're better at your job that the other admins on the team - then you're a threat to them. For the most part, admins used to stick together, now it's eat or be eaten.  •Trust no one.

However, I mainly I saw poor middle management, dysfunctional teams, constant re-orgs, back stabbing, empire building and cost cutting that during my time I was ""reduced in force"" twice on two teams. The first time I landed a new team and never left the company, the second time I wasn't given such luxury--despite getting 1s and 2s and promos over the last few years.  I left MS with a bitter feeling that I never found what I was looking for. I met some very intelligent people, but seemingly most had significant character flaws that were disastrous to building high performing teams. What frustrated the most was the constant empire building and self preservation that occurred at middle and upper management levels...basically what they tell you is just lip service to make you feel good, but no substance. (Not uncommon at big corporations, so that shouldn't be a surprise)  Before my second ""RIF"" I had two teams interested in having me move, but my last GM pleaded on two occasions that I not leave, so thinking I was favored by him that would mean a brighter future, so I stayed--yet not 3 months later I was axed with 4 other coworkers. Best I could figure is that we weren't ""diversified"" enough to keep, despite all being top team performers with important projects. Not sure who or how the layoff decision was made, but from my perspective, when you have common traits as far as gender, race, sexual orientation, you don't stand a chance if you are in competition with the more uncommon folks working next to you even if they perform worse. (Honestly, 4 individuals on that team who could be classified as diverse had either delivered nothing of important in years, stayed in the same role for many years, or actually screwed up to cost the company money.)

It's a dog eat dog environment, where how good you are, and how much you contribute has little to nothing to do with your chances of success, and how much you suck up to managers in your district, or how much ""visibility"" you have is the only measure of success. The fact that the hiring manager for the last job I had there over 9 years told me first and foremost 'lets figure out how to get you enough visibility so that I can defend you in the stack ranking' instead of discussing what I should be doing in my job says it all. This appears to be pretty much endemic at MS now, and every week I hear of yet another awesome employee leaving or being forced out. However, the Mid-Atlantic States District is particularly bad, with politics that I have never seen in my 20 years in IT and sales. MS also treats partners terribly. Partner CSAT scores are gamed.

The biggest thing I noticed is the leadership. There are many that are not the caliber of professional you would expect from a VP or GM of Microsoft.  The strategy of the Dynamics division is like dealing with an ADHD child. High-level strategy can change as soon as every six months and mid-level strategy can change as often as every quarter.  I have worked at Microsoft twice. The first time was as an employee of one of the above-mentioned acquisitions they made. It was one of the worst experiences of my professional career mainly due to the fact that Microsoft executive management allowed only one of the two ERP companies they acquired to manage the entire division and did not police them at all. My supposedly strategic team of 18 was laid off a few years later.  About 5 years later I found myself back at Microsoft Dynamics division with information that the internal product fighting was gone, so I thought it would be safe. Unfortunately the top management of my particular group was horrible and after two years I decided to leave again. I recently heard that HR finally acted on three years of negative feedback on these managers from their employees and removed them from power, but it was too late for me and many others.  The worst thing that applies to all of Microsoft is their annual review methodology. Each team manager is required to pick a percentage of their team for a high score, a percentage for a medium score and another percentage for a low score. Even if a manager had a team of superstars they would be forced to grade this way. It creates a lot of back stabbing and politics.  One last irritating thing is the blind loyalty they expect everyone to have toward their products. I understand the importance of supporting your employer by purchasing their products, but what if they produce inferior products? When the iPod first came out it was an unspoken taboo to own an iPod and not a Zune or some other MP3 player.

When I joined, I was surprised by a few things about the organization:  1) It's true that promotions are hard to come by. You could go on for years with pretty good annual reviews but still not be promoted for various reasons. This is incredibly frustrating and had I known this earlier, I would have done more then rather than to learn it after several years. But I believe it takes a certain type of person. You need to know how to manage upwards extremely well. Talk to your manager. Be firm about what you want and when. Be incredibly focused on what moves the needle. And have great impact and influence on others. It's easy to be distracted on other things.  2) It takes a long time to get things done. Because it's such a large organization, great ideas take time to cultivate and turn into solid strategy, priorities, and action items. There are so many people to get buy-in from. But if you build the relationships and understand how the system works, you learn to factor that into your daily work and projects. If you come from an entrepreneurial background and you are used to doing things quickly or on a whim to test out, etc, then I would caution you to think hard about this. Get used to simple things sometimes taking months to complete.  3) There are a lot of managers here who don't do a good job of balancing both their individual contributions with their managerial responsibilities.

Which means you have to have a manager who will fight for your promotion and is under pressure to keep employees at the levels hired, unless they've attracted senior level attention. Be bright, ambitious, and knife your way to the top: it's classic. Of course, the downside is you have to work in that environment.   The top 10% of the curve can be rewarded well, even lavishly, but performance won't be enough, you need to sail past your peers, so in a really quality group, you're screwed, somebody has to fill the middle or even the bottom of the curve. Microsoft has always been severely hierarchical - teams are for drones to follow orders.  Having 90,000 employees makes hierarchies seductively attractive for weak bureaucrats, and Microsoft does believe that excellence can be driven by the top 10%, which, if promotion was meritocracy-driven: maybe. But where smooth-talking politicians are easier to promote, the leadership can be hit and miss.  Microsoft, even for the fast-moving superstars, offers no training other than what's gleaned on the job, and given that a majority of top managers have never worked anywhere else and have no other perspective than 'drinking the corporate Kool-Aid', the probability of working for a bozo who is scared stiff and unable to function or promote team members, is, unfortunately, pretty freakin’ high.  Microsoft needs an intellectual enema: we have legions of people standing on their thumbs one minute and then racing 14 hour days trying to make things function. We have an obfuscating layer of untrained managers who squirm and hide when bold decisions or true leadership is required. The hierarchy that semi-functioned when Microsoft was small, no longer works. It causes huge inefficiencies and lost shareholder value as the numbers outstrip the ability of hierarchies to offer enlighten direction.

Product groups, despite the frequent mention of innovation in internal documentation, rarely have the patience for it. For someone that's worked in truly innovative environments, it may be disappointing to see what marketing will often label ""innovative"" to customers and employees. We rarely truly interact with customers until after we've built and shipped product Betas--which can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, depending on the project. Often, the features customers want are two to four years out from the request if they weren't included in the original product definition. Microsoft struggles with change from traditional development processes, although some groups are more proactive than others. Most engineers I know are not domain experts--and being a domain expert, particularly when you are new to the company and there are few to no other domain experts (particularly in management), means it will be hard to be heard unless you have stellar social skills (i.e. influence). Discpline managers (e.g. Software Engineer Managers) generally wield considerable authority, yet in my experience do not contribute to the discipline beyond process and negotiating contracts with other teams. Microsoft often talks about passion, but it will be frustrating to see discpline managers that ask you to come in on weekends and stay late, when they aren't rolling up their sleeves themselves. People are promoted into management too quickly, and many of these promotions seem to be based on friendship circles, so the heirarchy at Microsoft can be frustrating. Politics are prevalent. Employees are stack-ranked or ""calibrated"" against their peers (despite claims that this has changed, it has not) to determine yearly compensation and review, and this can adversely affect those that don't fall in line with their manager. Bullying is common, as is back-stabbing, and there is no effective outlet. I've seen slews of competent folks leave or be pushed out of teams due to empire building.

No accountability from senior management about quality of people being recruited.

You have to do buttering to your boss if you want any career growth at all, else you will be branded as ""lacking soft skills"". Technical skills and your work have zero value.  Rather than working for a common goal of creating great products, the company culture encourages people to step on others head and prove your ""visibility"", which is nothing but useless chattering and giving junk fundas etc.  As part of cost cutting, some of the best in-house engineering systems have been blindly demolished.  So many internal scams going on openly. They have banned team outings beyond 100 km distance but there exist several teams in Hyderabad who make trips to exotic destinations under the disguise of ""training"" and nobody questions it.  Internal employee survey is simply used as a means to identify and penalise the ""complainers"" rather than genuinely addressing the issues. After conducting a so-called ""anonymous"" annual poll, the HR will conduct team-by-team meetings (if team's review is bad) and will try their best to trap people into talking and indetifying those who raised any issues in the poll.

I mean: if your whole team is exceeding it never means everyone in the team get ""exceeded"". Managers explain that they have to assing different marks to the whole team so that the average was stable. Lots of attention is paid to newly learned term ""visibility"" which in short means that it is much more important to broadcast than to deliver, and the success is measured baised on your broadcasting.",No,No,3,5,Yes,No,[],No,Yes

Some of GMs and Directors were known miserable frontline managers yet grew because they had the right connections and played their cards well. They are a disgrace to be called Leaders. They have only grown their equally incompetent managers into roles of responsibility. They have a free hand and misuse there powers regularly with no checks at all in place. All sorts of bias in place - regional, caste, language, diversity just to name a few. 2. Performance reviews have nothing to do with performance, they are only about having more managers on your side in the calibration and supporting lies they can tell. The Microsoft performance framework isn't bad in itself, with all companies having some sort of a curve. It's the local misuse which is disgusting. 3. HR function has no control to ensure fairness. Corp doesn't care either in spite of repeated value and ethics violations by these so called leaders and being repeatedly brought out through employee surveys 4. Limited career growth opportunities within and external due to support tag. Internal Job openings are opened later, people to be hired identified first. No respect within other MS orgs for GTSC employees. 5. Offer seems very rosy initially and the brand sells it. It's only once you're in and take a couple of years to understand the game being played in the background, do you wake up. By then you're rusted out and worthless compared to the industry. Only way to succeed is be like these people, back stab your peers, do little yet project lots, leave your ethics and values outside the door, have sugar daddies who matter on your side, etc. etc. 6.

Most people came here straight from school and have made a good living by locking themselves in their office and newer people are straight from research vendors who know very little about what business impact means. Those that have more significant experiences either quickly leave or eventually sell out to this dysfunction kool-aide.
